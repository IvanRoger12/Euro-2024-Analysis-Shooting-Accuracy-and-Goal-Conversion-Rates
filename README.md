# Euro-2024-Analysis-Shooting-Accuracy-and-Goal-Conversion-Rates
Introduction
Welcome to the Euro 2024 Analysis project! This project provides an in-depth analysis of the shooting accuracy and goal conversion rates for the top teams in the Euro 2024 tournament. The analysis aims to reveal which teams are the most efficient in converting their chances into goals.

Project Description
This project uses simulated match statistics data to perform the following analyses:

Shooting Accuracy: Measures the percentage of shots that are on target out of the total shots taken by the team.
Goal Conversion Rate: Measures the percentage of shots on target that result in goals.
The analyses are visualized using bar charts to provide a clear and insightful view of the teams' performances.

Code and Analysis
The project includes the following steps:

Data Preparation: Simulated match statistics data including shots, shots on target, and goals.
Calculations: Calculate the shooting accuracy and goal conversion rates.
Visualization: Generate bar charts to visualize the shooting accuracy and goal conversion rates.
Here is a brief overview of the code used in this project:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulated match statistics data including shots on target
match_stats_data = {
    'Team': ['Germany', 'France', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'Portugal'],
    'Shots': [50, 60, 45, 55, 65],
    'Shots on Target': [20, 25, 18, 22, 24],
    'Goals': [12, 15, 10, 14, 16]
}

match_stats_df = pd.DataFrame(match_stats_data)

# Calculate shooting accuracy and conversion rate
match_stats_df['Shooting Accuracy (%)'] = (match_stats_df['Shots on Target'] / match_stats_df['Shots']) * 100
match_stats_df['Goal Conversion Rate (%)'] = (match_stats_df['Goals'] / match_stats_df['Shots on Target']) * 100

# Plotting the shooting accuracy and goal conversion rate
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(12, 12))

# Shooting Accuracy
axs[0].barh(match_stats_df['Team'], match_stats_df['Shooting Accuracy (%)'], color='skyblue')
axs[0].set_xlabel('Shooting Accuracy (%)')
axs[0].set_title('Shooting Accuracy of Teams in the Euro')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('shooting_accuracy.png')

# Goal Conversion Rate
axs[1].barh(match_stats_df['Team'], match_stats_df['Goal Conversion Rate (%)'], color='green')
axs[1].set_xlabel('Goal Conversion Rate (%)')
axs[1].set_title('Goal Conversion Rate of Teams in the Euro')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('goal_conversion_rate.png')

plt.close()
